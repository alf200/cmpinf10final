**Abstract:**

The aim of this project is to determine the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Through my analysis of three datasets, I have determined that Regent Square is unquestionably the best neighborhood in the city. Regent Square has had only 22 arrests since 2016, has zero parking meters, and one playground. To support my argument, I looked at data from three different datasets: Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data, Parking Meters, and City of Pittsburgh Playgrounds. The best neighborhood based on the data would be the one with the least arrests, least parking meters, and most playgrounds.

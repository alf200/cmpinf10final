**Abstract**
The aim of this project is to determine the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh. To support my argument, I will be looking at data from three different datasets: Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data, Parking Meters, and City of Pittsburgh Playgrounds. The "best" neighborhood based on my data would be the one with the least arrests, least parking meters, and most playgrounds.
